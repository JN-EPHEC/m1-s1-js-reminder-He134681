# Week 1: Introduction & Modern JavaScript Fundamentals

Welcome to the first week of our course on mobile development with React Native! This week, we are laying the essential groundwork by ensuring everyone is comfortable with modern JavaScript features. These concepts are crucial, as React and React Native use them extensively.

## Weekly Objectives

- **Master** key JavaScript ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`).
- **Understand** and **use** asynchronous programming with Promises and the `async/await` syntax.
- **Set up** your work environment and get familiar with this course's Git workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the exercises, please ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. **Install Node.js:**  
   Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en).  
   _Note: Node.js is required to run JavaScript code outside the browser and to use modern development tools._

2. **Verify Node.js Installation:**  
   Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and run:

```bash
node -v
```

You should see the installed Node.js version number. If you see an error, repeat the installation process.

3. **Choose and Install a Code Editor:**  
   We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for its features and integration with JavaScript/TypeScript.

- Download and install Visual Studio Code, or use another editor of your choice (e.g., Sublime Text, Atom).

4. **Install Git:**  
   If you do not already have Git installed, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the installation instructions.

- Verify installation by running:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
  You should see the installed Git version.

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to proceed with the exercises.

## Practical Exercises

To complete these exercises, follow this procedure:

1.  Make sure you are on the `main` branch: `git checkout main`
2.  Create and switch to the exercises branch: `git checkout -b week1-js-exercises`
3.  Create an `exercise1.mjs` file where you will write your solutions. Write your results in console (`console.log()`).
4.  Execute the script using `node exercise1.mjs`
5.  Once the exercises are complete, commit your changes on this branch. **Do not merge it into `main`**.

### Exercise 1: Data Manipulation

```bash
‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è
"It's useless to use generative AI for this part, it has no sense. Please play the game, as the main goal is to learn. It's useful to master these JavaScript concepts before starting to work with React Native."
‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è
```

Given the following array of data, write the code to perform the operations listed below using modern array manipulation methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`).

```javascript
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 28, specialty: "Marketing" },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 35, specialty: "Engineering" },
  { id: 3, name: "Charlie", age: 22, specialty: "Marketing" },
  { id: 4, name: "David", age: 42, specialty: "Engineering" },
  { id: 5, name: "Eve", age: 29, specialty: "Design" },
];
```

1.  **User Names:** Create a new variable `userNames` that contains an array with only the names of all users.
    - _Expected result:_ `['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve']`
2.  **Engineers:** Create a new variable `engineers` that contains an array of user objects working in the 'Engineering' specialty.
    - _Expected result:_ `[{ id: 2, ... }, { id: 4, ... }]`
3.  **Average Age:** Calculate the average age of all users and store it in a variable `averageAge`.
    - _Expected result:_ `31.2`
4.  **User Descriptions:** Create a new variable `userDescriptions` which is an array of strings describing each user.
    - _Expected format:_ `"Alice is 28 years old."`

### Exercise 2: Asynchronicity

1.  **Simulation Function:** Create an asynchronous function named `WorkspaceUserProfile`. This function will take a `userId` as a parameter.
2.  **Simulate Latency:** Inside the function, use `new Promise` and `setTimeout` to simulate a network call that takes 2 seconds to respond.
3.  **Result:** If the `userId` is `123`, the promise should resolve with an object `{ name: 'John Doe', status: 'Active' }`. For any other `userId`, the promise should reject with a `new Error('User not found')`.
4.  **Function Call:** Call this function with a valid `userId`, and then with an invalid `userId`, using `async/await` and a `try...catch` block to properly handle the response and errors. Log the results or errors to the console.

## üè† Homework Assignment üè†

```bash
"If you achieve this exercice, you are more than ready to start working with React Native and the group project."
```

```
This assignment counts towards the continuous assessment grade for this course. As a reminder, continuous assessment represents 30% of the final grade.

‚ö†Ô∏è You are allowed to discuss the material with your classmates to aid understanding. However, any plagiarism will be penalized, and a grade of 0 will be given to all parties involved. If this occurs, thorough checks will be carried out on all future assignments.

You are not prohibited from using generative AI tools for your assignments. If you do use them, please add the prompts you used as comments in your code.

Your 'main' branch must be up to date by the defined deadline!
```

For this assignment, you will work on the `main` branch. When finished, you will `commit` and `push` your changes to your GitHub Classroom repository. Also, write your code directly in the `src/index.ts` file.

To get the dataset, you will use the public **JSONPlaceholder** API to fetch a list of "todos".

```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
```

1.  **The script:**
    1. Write an asynchronous function named `fetchAndFilterTodos`.
       - Inside this function, use the `fetch API` to retrieve the data from the URL.
       - After that, if there is a bad status (property `ok` is false on your response), you have to write a log message saying `"Network response was not ok"` in the console.
    - Once the data is correctly fetched, `parse` the JSON result as an Object.
    - Then, filter this list to keep only the `"todos"` that are **completed** (`completed: true`).
    - Log the `number of completed tasks` and the `list of their titles` to the console.
    - Handle potential errors (e.g., network call failure) with a `try...catch` block.
